ANN Predictive Modeling of Retail Sales and Markdown Impact using streamlit and deploy the same in AWS(using tensorflow)

Introduction :

This project aims to develop a predictive ANN model to forecast department-wide sales for each store over the next year and analyze the impact of markdowns on sales during holiday weeks.

Dataset : Provides historical sales data for 45 retail stores.

Stores Tab: Contains anonymized information about the stores, including store type and size.
Features Tab: Contains additional data related to store, department, and regional activity, including temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment, and markdown data.
Sales Tab: Historical sales data covering from February 5, 2010, to November 1, 2012, including weekly sales figures and holiday indicators.
Project Workflow

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handle missing values, convert date formats, and ensure appropriate data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze sales trends, holiday impacts, and feature correlations.
Feature Engineering: Create lag features, holiday-specific features, and interaction features between markdowns and holidays.
Modeling: Time Series Models, Deep Learning Models (e.g., ANN using tensorflow with different architecture), Markdown Impact Analysis using statistical techniques.
Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance, with a focus on holiday weeks.
Insights and Recommendations: Derive actionable insights and recommend strategies for sales and markdown optimization.
